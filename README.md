## krep

Search for text in files. Similar to `grep` or `ag` but *way* more **colorful** ðŸ˜‹
    
```sh
krep string    # search recursively in the current directory for 'string'
    
krep string .. # same as above, but in the parent directory

krep .. string # dito

krep file      # prints the whole file

krep -h        # for more options
```
